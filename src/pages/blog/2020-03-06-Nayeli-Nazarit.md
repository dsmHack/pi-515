The most fun about Pi515 has been working with middle school students to teach them how to code! Also, working with my Pi515 teammates to build a shopping app for the Congressional App Challenge was a fun and great learning experience!
I have learned the languages: HTML, CSS, and Java. We made our own websites and presented them to employees at American Equity. I have also learned so much about this career field. I feel like the opportunities are endless. Moreover, it has taught me more about collaboration. Since it will be crucial to have in our future jobs, I believe it is important.
