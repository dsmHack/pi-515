**K**evontae started coming to PI515 because his girlfriend, Jessica was our web class assistant. Jessica had joined our class in 9th grade and had become a pro in web development. Jessica’s PI515 job in 10th grade was to assist our Web Development class instructor, John Dillon, a Central college student. At PI515, we not only teach tech, but also encourage our students teach the skills they learn to their peers.

**K**evontae’s initial goal was to spend more time with Jessica, but after a few visits we convinced Kevontae to join the class. Kevontae has now graduated high school and will be attending college this fall. He plans to pursue Computer Science.
In 2019–2020 School year,
