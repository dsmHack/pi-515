'This repo is the main webpage for Pi515. It is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.


## Tech Stack 🥞
- Website: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Styling: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- CMS: [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)
- Build: [Netlify](http://netlify.com/)

## Development
### Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)

- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

### Running Locally

Clone this repository and do the following
```
npm install
gatsby develop
```

This will create a local version of website that hot-reloads to show changes as you make them

### Testing CMS locally
To test the CMS locally, you'll need to run a production build of the site:

```
$ npm run build
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

### Setting up the CMS
